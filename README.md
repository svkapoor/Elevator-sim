## Commands
| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `p <floor>` | Add a pickup request |
| `s` | Show current elevator state |
| `q` | Quit simulation |

## Assumptions
- The building consists of **floors 0 through 10**.  
- Only **one elevator** is available in the simulation.  
- The elevator starts at **floor 0** by default.  
- The elevator moves one floor at a time toward its target.
